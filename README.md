# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices-with-Python

## Introduction
I participated in the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle competition as a side project. The code in this Jupyter notebook resulted in a RMSE score of 0.12402 and a ranking in the top 8% of competition participants. This repository contains a jupyter notebook with the python code and process description, the train data, the test data and a txt file with descriptions of the variables. The competition can be found here:  [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and you can verify my score by searching the leaderbaord for Kyle-t-Schmidt.

For this project I used a combination of knowledge in statistics and compter science. In this Jupyter notebook I demonstrate:
* Python for data science
* Data maipulation with Numpy and Pandas
* Data exploration
* Data visualization
* Normality testing
* Outlier testing
* Data imputation
* Covariation testing
* Variable encoding
* Cross Validation
* Regression model building

## Program Purpose
The House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle competition provides a data set with 79 variables describing houses sold in Ames, Iowa. Sale prices are provided for half of the data to train a regression algorithm and sale prices are withheld on the other half for testing. After creating an algorithm and predicitng the house sale prices on the test data set, submissions are stored in csv format, uploaded to kaggle and scored with the root mean square error (rmse).


## Using the program
The Jupyter notebook (ipynb file) contains all python code and explanation of the process. In order to run the code you will need to follow these steps:
* download the test.csv and train.csv files and store them locally on your computer
* update the file paths in the first and last code blocks to the location where the test and train files are located.
